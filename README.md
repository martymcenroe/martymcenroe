### Hi, I'm Marty McEnroe 👋

I am an **Enterprise Architect** and **AI Strategist** with a deep background in engineering, cloud infrastructure, and application security.

My passion is architecting **robust**, high-value solutions. My architectural philosophy balances elegance and simplicity with a pragmatic focus on execution; I prioritize accelerating the path from concept to robust, working code.

This GitHub is my professional portfolio, showcasing enterprise-ready projects in Generative AI, MLOps, and Cloud-Native Security.

## 🚀 My Portfolio: From Architecture to Execution

This is my active portfolio of enterprise-ready projects. Each repository is built as a complete architectural solution, not just a script.

* **[Iconoscope (AI Video Analysis)](https://github.com/martymcenroe/iconoscope):** An enterprise-ready, Azure-native AI video analysis platform. This project demonstrates a complete **AI strategy**, a governed **MLOps lifecycle** (Azure DevOps, MLflow), and a **statistically-backed** GenAI (RAG) pipeline for insight synthesis.

* **[GlucoPulse.ai (AI Health)](https://github.com/martymcenroe/GlucoPulse.ai):** An enterprise-grade AI health platform demonstrating a complete model lifecycle for time-series data, integrating **Snowflake Cortex**, **Azure ML**, and **LangChain** for GenAI-driven RAG.

* **[NEC 2017 Analyzer (Domain Tool)](https://github.com/martymcenroe/nec2017-analyzer):** A domain-specific tool for parsing and analyzing the National Electric Code, reflecting my background as a Professional Engineer (PE).
